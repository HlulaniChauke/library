This is a small library web app
This represents a simple library management system implemented in JavaScript, using HTML for the user interface. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

    Dummy Data and Book Class:
        It initializes an empty array called library to store book objects.
        Defines a Book class with a constructor to create book objects with properties like author, title, pages, and read status.

    Adding Dummy Books:
        A function addBookToLibrary is defined to add a new book to the library array. It creates a new book object using the Book class and adds it to the library array.
        A loop adds five dummy books to the library using the addBookToLibrary function.

    Displaying Books in a Table:
        The code selects the <tbody> element from the HTML, which presumably is a table body for displaying books.
        The displayEachBook function creates table rows and cells for each book and populates them with book information (title, author, pages).
        The read status is displayed as a button that toggles between "Read" and "Not Read."
        A remove button is also added to each row.

    Displaying Existing Books:
        Another loop iterates over the existing books in the library and calls displayEachBook to display each book in the table.

    Event Listener for Table Clicks:
        An event listener is added to the table body to handle clicks. If a click is on a remove button, it removes the corresponding row from the table. If a read button is clicked, it toggles between "Read" and "Not Read."

    Adding New Books:
        The code selects various HTML elements related to adding a new book, such as the "Add New Book" button, input fields for title, author, and pages.
        An event listener is added to the "Add New Book" button. When clicked, it validates the input for the number of pages using a regex. If valid, it adds the new book to the library and displays it in the table. Input fields are then cleared. If the input is invalid, an alert is shown.
